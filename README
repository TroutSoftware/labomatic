# Lab-O-Matic: A Language Description for Labs

labomatic is a tool to configure and run a lab.
It aims to provide a singular point in the lab creation space:
 - use configuration-as-code (versioning, …)
 - the network structure is described using Python (Starlark)
 - all systems are image-based, with a new well-known images
 - we only aim to emulate SME-level infrastructure
 - QEMU + netlink
 - minimalist

Other tools (netlab, containerlab, …) will make different choices.
